  editEIDR:
    comments:
    - 'An [EIDR](https://eidr.org/) (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]]
      representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television.


      For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" whose [[titleEIDR]]
      is "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J", has several edits e.g. "10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"
      and "10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3".


      Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both
      works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone
      (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific
      description.

  EndorsementRating:
    comments:
    - 'An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement,
      for example inclusion in a "critic''s pick" blog, a

      "Like" or "+1" on a social network. It can be considered the [[result]] of an
      [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively
      by

      some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful
      to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the
      [[Action]].


      An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system,
      but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,

      endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as
      it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.

      In British English a campsite, or campground, is an area, usually divided into
      a number of pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents or camper vans
      or caravans; this British English use of the word is synonymous with the American
      English expression campground. In American English the term campsite generally
      means an area where an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch
      a tent or park a camper; a campground may contain many campsites.

      \ and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\n\
      expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges\
      \ from use. In addition to our\nusual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490),\
      \ feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).\n\
      \n\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information,\
      \ it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol),\
      \ although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\nthe kinds of everyday\
      \ practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency\
      \ situation.\n\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:\n\nWe encourage\
      \ the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires\" (if appropriate),\
      \ \"category\" and\n\"url\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide\
      \ a value for \"category\" where possible, most ideally as a well known\nURL\
      \ from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic,\
      \ this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\\
      _pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\".\n\nFor many of the\
      \ possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description,\
      \ depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the\
      \ URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description,\
      \ use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside\
      \ at least a simple \"[[text]]\" summary of the page. It is\nunlikely that a\
      \ single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.\n\
      \nWe expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized\
      \ structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]]\
      \ etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help\
      \ make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus)\
      \ indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].\n\n\
      Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable\
      \ local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]]\
      \ to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement\
      \ affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library\
      \ closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].\n\
      \nThe [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus\
      \ of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only\nfor representing\
      \ non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places,\
      \ use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup\
      \ should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of /about for locations\
      \ too.\n\nThe basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of\
      \ an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard))\
      \ feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be\
      \ shared by posting\n[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD.\
      \ For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\nwith the [[webFeed]]\
      \ property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with\
      \ [[encodingFormat]] providing\nmedia type information e.g. \"application/rss+xml\"\
      \ or \"application/atom+xml\".\n"

  Campground:
    comments:
    - 'A camping site, campsite, or [[Campground]] is a place used for overnight stay
      in the outdoors, typically containing individual [[CampingPitch]] locations.
      \n\n

      In British English a campsite is an area, usually divided into a number of pitches,
      where people can camp overnight using tents or camper vans or caravans; this
      British English use of the word is synonymous with the American English expression
      campground. In American English the term campsite generally means an area where
      an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch a tent or park a camper;
      a campground may contain many campsites (Source: Wikipedia see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite)).\n\n

      \ For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles,\

      \ type is based on a stricter ideal for \"news\" as a work of journalism, with\

      \ or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes\
      \ perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing\
      \ news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the [[ReportageNewsArticle]]\

  Claim:
    comments:
    - "A [[Claim]] in Schema.org represents a specific, factually-oriented claim that\
      \ could be the [[itemReviewed]] in a [[ClaimReview]]. The content of a claim\
      \ can be summarized with the [[text]] property. Variations on well known claims\
      \ can have their common identity indicated via [[sameAs]] links, and summarized\
      \ with a [[name]]. Ideally, a [[Claim]] description includes enough contextual\
      \ information to minimize the risk of ambiguity or inclarity. In practice, many\
      \ claims are better understood in the context in which they appear or the interpretations\
      \ provided by claim reviews.\n\n  Beyond [[ClaimReview]], the Claim type can\
      \ be associated with related creative works - for example a [[ScholarlyArticle]]\
      \ or [[Question]] might be [[about]] some [[Claim]].\n\n  At this time, Schema.org\
      \ does not define any types of relationship between claims. This is a natural\

  CriticReview:

      online columns, travel and food guides, TV and radio shows, blogs and other
      independent Web sites. [[CriticReview]]s are typically more in-depth and professionally
      written. For simpler, casually written user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews,
      it is more appropriate to use the [[UserReview]] type. Review aggregator sites
      such as Metacritic already separate out the site's user reviews from selected
      critic reviews that originate from third-party sources.

  MedicalCause:
    comments:
    - The causative agent(s) that are responsible for the pathophysiologic process
      that eventually results in a medical condition, symptom or sign. In this schema,
      unless otherwise specified this is meant to be the proximate cause of the medical
      condition, symptom or sign. The proximate cause is defined as the causative
      agent that most directly results in the medical condition, symptom or sign.
      For example, the HIV virus could be considered a cause of AIDS. Or in a diagnostic
      context, if a patient fell and sustained a hip fracture and two days later sustained
      a pulmonary embolism which eventuated in a cardiac arrest, the cause of the
      cardiac arrest (the proximate cause) would be the pulmonary embolism and not
      the fall. Medical causes can include cardiovascular, chemical, dermatologic,
      endocrine, environmental, gastroenterologic, genetic, hematologic, gynecologic,
      iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, nutritional, obstetric,
      oncologic, otolaryngologic, pharmacologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, renal, rheumatologic,
      toxic, traumatic, or urologic causes; medical conditions can be causes as well.

  SuperficialAnatomy:
    comments:
    - Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including
      the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that
      correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important
      role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying
      anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example,
      during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae
      to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used
      to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located
      by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the
      humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size,
      prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue
      support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral
      joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing
      to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially
      visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula,
      implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).
