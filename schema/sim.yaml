  sim_Association:
    class_uri: sim:Association
    description: An abstract class to define some association between things.  Entities
      share an association if they are somehow inter-connected.  Generally a <b>directed
      association</b> should have at lease one <code>sim:subject</code> property and
      one <code>sim:object</code> property <b>or</b> an <b>undirected association</b>
      should have at least two <code>sim:element</code> properties, however this is
      not a requirement and intentionally left out of the model.
