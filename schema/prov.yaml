      it is useful for explaining its other concepts and its semantics.'
    description: An instantaneous event, or event for short, happens in the world
      and marks a change in the world, in its activities and in its entities. The
      term 'event' is commonly used in process algebra with a similar meaning. Events

    description: An entity that is a specialization of another shares all aspects
      of the latter, and additionally presents more specific aspects of the same thing
      as the latter. In particular, the lifetime of the entity being specialized contains
      that of any specialization. Examples of aspects include a time period, an abstraction,
      and a context associated with the entity.
