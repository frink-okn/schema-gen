      creators, title, version, archive, publication year, DOI or other identifier).

      entities that describe aspects of the referenced work - for example authors,

      that because different journal styles may require omission of elements of the
      bibliographic record in references included in a paper''s reference list (e.g.
      the title, the identifier, the names of the eighth and subsequent authors),
      and because errors can be introduced when an author creates a bibliographic
      reference, the bibliographic reference to a published work may not be a complete
      or fully accurate expression of the information contained within the authoritative
      bibliographic record for that work.'

- "description: BiRO, the Bibliographic Reference Ontology, is an ontology structured\
  \ according to the FRBR model to define bibliographic records (as subclasses of\
  \ frbr:Work) and bibliographic references (as subclasses of frbr:Expression), and\
  \ their compilations into bibliographic collections such as library catalogues,\
  \ and into bibliographic lists such as reference lists in journal articles, respectively.\u240A\
  \u240AIt provides a logical system for relating an individual bibliographic reference,\
  \ such as appears in the reference list of a published article (which may lack the\
  \ title of the cited article, the full names of the listed authors, or indeed the\
  \ full list of authors):\u240A- to the full bibliographic record for that cited\
  \ article, which in addition to missing reference fields may also include the name\
  \ of the publisher, and the ISSN or ISBN of the publication;\u240A- to collections\
  \ of bibliographic records such as library catatlogues; and\u240A- to bibliographic\
  \ lists, such as reference lists."
