    - 'description: A collection of bibliographic records, each of which references
      a publication (or a work in preparation for publication). Examples of bibliographic
      collections include a collection of the bibliographic records of all the publications
      that a single individual has authored, or a collection of those bibliographic
      records to be included in a research paper, where they are expressed as a reference
      list.'
    description: A bibliographic collection is composed only of items containing bibliographic
      records.  Moreover, it cannot be part of other bibliographic collections, and
      it is realized only by bibliographic lists.

    - 'description: A record that uniquely describes a particular textual or data
      publication (or a work in preparation for publication). Each bibliographic record
      is a set of entities describing aspects of the referenced work, including, for
      example, but not restricted to: authors, title, journal, publication year, DOI,
      ISSN, publisher and copyright information, or, in the case of a data publication:
      creators, title, version, archive, publication year, DOI or other identifier).
      The FRBR expression of a bibliographic record is a bibliographic reference,
      which usually contains only a sub-set of these entities, ordered in a particular
      way that corresponds to the house style of the publication in which it occurs.'

    - 'description: An expression of a bibliographic record in a specific format,
      that references a particular textual or data publication (or a work in preparation
      for publication). Each bibliographic reference is a list of items containing
      entities that describe aspects of the referenced work - for example authors,
      title, journal, publication year - selected from the bibliographic record.  Note
      that because different journal styles may require omission of elements of the
      bibliographic record in references included in a paper''s reference list (e.g.
      the title, the identifier, the names of the eighth and subsequent authors),
      and because errors can be introduced when an author creates a bibliographic
      reference, the bibliographic reference to a published work may not be a complete
      or fully accurate expression of the information contained within the authoritative
      bibliographic record for that work.'
    description: A bibliographic reference is a realization of a bibliographic record.
      Moreover, it can contain only items referring to elements contained by the bibliographic
      record it realizes.

- "description: BiRO, the Bibliographic Reference Ontology, is an ontology structured\
  \ according to the FRBR model to define bibliographic records (as subclasses of\
  \ frbr:Work) and bibliographic references (as subclasses of frbr:Expression), and\
  \ their compilations into bibliographic collections such as library catalogues,\
  \ and into bibliographic lists such as reference lists in journal articles, respectively.\u240A\
  \u240AIt provides a logical system for relating an individual bibliographic reference,\
  \ such as appears in the reference list of a published article (which may lack the\
  \ title of the cited article, the full names of the listed authors, or indeed the\
  \ full list of authors):\u240A- to the full bibliographic record for that cited\
  \ article, which in addition to missing reference fields may also include the name\
  \ of the publisher, and the ISSN or ISBN of the publication;\u240A- to collections\
  \ of bibliographic records such as library catatlogues; and\u240A- to bibliographic\
  \ lists, such as reference lists."
