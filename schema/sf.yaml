    - 'description: A Surface is a 2-dimensional geometric object.

      A simple Surface may consists of a single patch that is associated with one
      exterior boundary and 0 or more interior boundaries. A single such Surface patch
      in 3-dimensional space is isometric to planar Surfaces, by a simple affine rotation
      matrix that rotates the patch onto the plane z = 0. If the patch is not vertical,
      the projection onto the same plane is an isomorphism, and can be represented
      as a linear transformation, i.e. an affine.


      Polyhedral Surfaces are formed by stitching together such simple Surfaces patches
      along their common boundaries. Such polyhedral Surfaces in a 3-dimensional space
      may not be planar as a whole, depending on the orientation of their planar normals.
      If all the patches are in alignment (their normals are parallel), then the whole
      stitched polyhedral surface is co-planar and can be represented as a single
      patch if it is connected.


      The boundary of a simple Surface is the set of closed Curves corresponding to
      its exterior and interior boundaries.


      A Polygon is a simple Surface that is planar. A PolyhedralSurface is a simple
      surface, consisting of some number of Polygon patches or facets. If a PolyhedralSurface
      is closed, then it bounds a solid. A MultiSurface containing a set of closed
