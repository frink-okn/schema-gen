    class_uri: adms:Asset
    description: An Asset is an abstract entity that reflects the intellectual content
      of the asset and represents those characteristics of the asset that are independent
      of its physical embodiment. This abstract entity combines the FRBR entities
      work (a distinct intellectual or artistic creation) and expression (the intellectual
      or artistic realization of a work). Assets can be versioned. Every time the
      intellectual content of an asset changes, the result is considered to be a new
      asset that can be linked to previous and next versions of the Asset. The physical
      embodiment of an Asset is called an Asset Distribution. A particular Asset may
      have zero or more Asset Distributions..

    description: An Asset Distribution represents a particular physical embodiment
      of an Asset, which is an example of the FRBR entity manifestation (the physical
      embodiment of an expression of a work). An Asset Distribution is typically a
      downloadable computer file (but in principle it could also be a paper document)
      that implements the intellectual content of an Asset. A particular Asset Distribution
      is associated with one and only one Asset, while all Distributions of an Asset
      share the same intellectual content in different physical formats. Asset Distributions
      themselves are not versioned.

      In RDF this is expressed using the following properties: - the content string
      should be provided using skos:notation, datatyped with the identifier scheme
      (inclduing the version number if appropriate); - use dcterms:creator to link
      to a class describing the agency that manages the identifier scheme or adms:schemaAgency
      to provide the name as a literal. Although not part of the ADMS conceptual model,
      it may be useful to provide further properties to the Identifier class such
