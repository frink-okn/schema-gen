                          \ debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy direction.\
                          \ In addition, the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking,\

    description: fluorite, also called FLUORSPAR, common halide mineral, calcium fluoride
      (CaF2); the principal fluorine mineral. It is usually quite pure, but as much
      as 20 percent yttrium or cerium may replace calcium. Fluorite occurs most commonly
      as a glassy, many-hued vein mineral and is often associated with lead and silver
      ores; it also occurs in cavities, in sedimentary rocks, in pegmatites, and in
      hot-springs areas. It is widespread in China, South Africa, Mongolia, France,
      Mexico, Russia, and the central United States. Fluorite is used as a flux in
      the manufacture of open-hearth steel, of aluminum fluoride, of artificial cryolite,
      and of aluminum. It is used in opalescent glass, in iron and steel enamelware,
      in the production of hydrofluoric acid, in the refining of lead and antimony,
      and in the manufacture of high-octane fuels (as a catalyst). Because of its
      low index of refraction and low dispersion, clear, colourless fluorite of optical
      quality is used for apochromatic lenses. At one time blue john, a variety from
      Derbyshire, Eng., was widely used in ornamental vases and other objects. Britannica.

      \ cost of manufacturing processes. Such manufacturing processes contribute relatively\
      \ little to the value of primary goods, such as crude petroleum and cotton,\
      \ which undergo little processing before they are traded. The term commodity\
      \ is typically used as a synonym for primary goods.\u240A\u240AHere, however,\
      \ we are using the term commodity in a broader sense.  A commodity is any sort\
      \ of product (manufactured, primary, or even services) that can usefully be\
      \ viewed and measured as a (continuous) quantity.  The commodity class includes\
      \ carpets, wood pulp, medical equipment, and investment services.  It includes\
      \ services to construct nuclear power plants, but not the power plants themselves.\u240A\
      \u240AThe Fact Book focuses on commodities that play a major role in a nations\

    description: the most abundant of three naturally occurring forms of titanium
      dioxide (TiO2; see also anatase; brookite). It forms red to reddish brown, hard,
      brilliant metallic, slender crystals, often completely surrounded by other minerals.
      Rutile is a commercially important titanium mineral, although most titanium
      dioxide is produced from ilmenite. Rutile has minor uses in porcelain and glass
      manufacture as a colouring agent and in making some steels and copper alloys.

    description: Taro, also called EDDO, or DASHEEN, herbaceous plant of the family
      Araceae. Probably native to southeastern Asia, whence it has spread to the Pacific
      islands, it has become a staple crop cultivated for its large, starchy, spherical
      underground tubers, which are consumed as cooked vegetables, made into puddings
      and breads, and also made into the Polynesian poi, a thin, pasty, highly digestible
      mass of fermented taro starch. The large leaves of the taro are commonly stewed.

      assistance which is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote
      economic development and welfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at
      least 25%. OOF transactions are also official government assistance, but with
      a main objective other than development and with a grant element less than 25%.
      OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits),
      official equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the official
      sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to have been
      committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and constitute
      a formal declaration of intent.

    description: 'In the &quot;Economy&quot; section, GDP dollar estimates for all
      countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather
      than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method normally
      involves the use of international dollar price weights, which are applied to
      the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In addition
      to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the statistician
      faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing for the quality
      of goods and services. The division of a GDP estimate in local currency by the
      corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. On average,
      one thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one
      thousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate
      - will buy in the other country. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are
      quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations.
      Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation of numbers published by
      the UN International Comparison Program and by Professors Robert Summers and
      Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. Currency
      exchange rates depend on a variety of international and domestic financial forces
      that often have little relation to domestic output. In developing countries
      with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically
      one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly
      go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas
      real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14
      countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to the
      French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not
      cut the real output of these countries by half. One important caution: the proportion
      of, say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency accounts
      may differ substantially from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed
      in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar
      level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: The numbers for GDP
      and other economic data can not be chained together from successive volumes
      of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions
      of data by statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of information,
      and changes in national statistical methods and practices.'

    description: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development
      assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is defined as financial
      assistance which is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote
      economic development and welfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at
      least 25%. OOF transactions are also official government assistance, but with
      a main objective other than development and with a grant element less than 25%.
      OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits),
      official equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the official
      sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to have been
      committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and constitute
      a formal declaration of intent.
