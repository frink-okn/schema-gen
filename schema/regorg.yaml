    description: "rov:RegisteredOrganization is the key class for the Registered Organization\
      \ vocabulary and represents \u240A    an organization that is legally registered.\
      \ In many countries there is a single registry although in others, such \u240A\
      \    as Spain and Germany, multiple registries exist. A Registered Organization\
      \ is able to trade, is legally liable for \u240A    its actions, accounts, tax\
      \ affairs etc. Legal entity status is conferred by the act of registration cf.\
      \ \u240A    org:FormalOrganization that applies to any legal entity, including\
      \ those created by other legal means.\u240A    This makes registered organizations\
      \ distinct from the broader concept of organizations, groups or, in \u240A \
      \   some jurisdictions, sole traders. Many organizations exist that are not\
      \ legal entities yet to the outside world \u240A    they have staff, hierarchies,\
      \ locations etc. Other organizations exist that are an umbrella for several\
      \ legal entities \u240A    (universities are often good examples of this). This\
      \ vocabulary is concerned solely with registered organizations.\u240A    In\
      \ RDF, Registered Organization is a sub class of the Organization Ontology's\
      \ org:FormalOrganization which is itself a \u240A    sub class of the more general\
      \ 'Agent' class found in FOAF and Dublin Core that does encompass organizations,\
      \ \u240A    natural persons, groups etc. - i.e. an Agent is any entity that\
      \ is able to carry out actions.</p>"
