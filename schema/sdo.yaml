      purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries
      is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such
      as TV, radio and games).\n\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing [[TVSeries]],
      [[RadioSeries]], [[MovieSeries]], [[BookSeries]], [[Periodical]] and [[VideoGameSeries]].
      In each case, the [[hasPart]] / [[isPartOf]] properties can be used to relate
      the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves
      largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.\n\nIt is
      common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied
      to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases,
      but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the
      series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.

      embolism and not the fall. Medical causes can include cardiovascular, chemical,

      gynecologic, iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, nutritional,

      \ update\u240A      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.\
      \  It represents an information update made by a\u240A      locally-oriented\
      \ organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community\
      \ groups, police,\u240A      local government.\u240A\u240AFor work in progress\
      \ guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).\u240A\
      \u240AThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic),\
      \ and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\u240A\
      expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges\
      \ from use. In addition to our\u240Ausual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490),\
      \ feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).\u240A\
      \u240A\u240AWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related\
      \ information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol),\
      \ although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\u240Athe kinds of everyday\
      \ practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency\
      \ situation.\u240A\u240ASeveral kinds of information can be provided:\u240A\u240A\
      We encourage the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires\"\
      \ (if appropriate), \"category\" and\u240A\"url\" as a simple baseline. It is\
      \ important to provide a value for \"category\" where possible, most ideally\
      \ as a well known\u240AURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020\
      \ Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\\
      _coronavirus\\_pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\".\u240A\
      \u240AFor many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links\
      \ or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For\
      \ a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value.\
      \ For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url\
      \ as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \"[[text]]\" summary of\
      \ the page. It is\u240Aunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need\
      \ all of the possible properties simultaneously.\u240A\u240AWe expect that in\
      \ many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data,\
      \ e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking\
      \ to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer\
      \ that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated\
      \ by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].\u240A\u240AMany\
      \ [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable\
      \ local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]]\
      \ to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement\
      \ affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library\
      \ closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].\u240A\
      \u240AThe [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus\
      \ of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only\u240Afor representing\
      \ non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places,\
      \ use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup\
      \ should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for\
      \ locations too.\u240A\u240AThe basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is\
      \ similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard))\
      \ feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be\
      \ shared by posting\u240A[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using\
      \ JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\u240A\
      with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]]\
      \ object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing\u240Amedia type information, e.g.\
      \ \"application/rss+xml\" or \"application/atom+xml\"."

      \ that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a [[StatisticalPopulation]]\

      \ would be described by applying the appropriate [[homeLocation]] and [[populationType]]\
      \ properties to a [[StatisticalPopulation]] item that stands for that set of\
      \ people.\u240AThe properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constraintProperty]]\

      \ the population. Note that the sense of \"population\" used here is the general\
      \ sense of a statistical\u240Apopulation, and does not imply that the population\

  sdos_StatisticalVariable:
    class_uri: sdos:StatisticalVariable
    description: '[[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric
      that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]]
      is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]],
      which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]]
      is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed
      using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical
      variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For
      example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing
      the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type
      is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]];
      the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds
      of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously
      described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The
      approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description
      of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property
      IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and
      [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and
      notation of an observed measurement.'

    description: Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection),
      including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks
      that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays
      an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties
      as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation.
      For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate
      and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial
      anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital
      vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the
      epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the
      vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel
      of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation)
      of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid
      muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula
      to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges
      of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related
      anatomical structure).

      \ can also be used for percentage amounts. In such cases, value is used to represent\
      \ the incentive\u2019s percentage, while maxValue represents a limit (if one\
      \ exists) to that incentive. The unitCode should be 'P1' and the unitText should\
      \ be '%', while valueReference should be used for holding the currency type.\
      \ For example, \"You can claim up to 30% of the total cost of installation,\
      \ up to a maximum of $7,500\" would be:</p>\u240A    {\u240A        \"@type\"\

      The identifier should be in the `XXXX:YYYYYY:ZZZ` or `XXXX:YYYYYY`format. Where
      `XXXX` is a 4 digit _ICD_ (International Code Designator), `YYYYYY` is an _OID_
      (Organization Identifier) with all formatting characters (dots, dashes, spaces)
      removed with a maximal length of 35 characters, and `ZZZ` is an optional OPI
      (Organization Part Identifier) with a maximum length of 35 characters. The various
      components (ICD, OID, OPI) are joined with a colon character (ASCII `0x3a`).
      Note that many existing organization identifiers defined as attributes like
      [leiCode](https://schema.org/leiCode) (`0199`), [duns](https://schema.org/duns)
      (`0060`) or [GLN](https://schema.org/globalLocationNumber) (`0088`) can be expressed
      using ISO-6523. If possible, ISO-6523 codes should be preferred to populating
      [vatID](https://schema.org/vatID) or [taxID](https://schema.org/taxID), as ISO
      identifiers are less ambiguous.

      manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact.
      It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream"
      sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g.
      a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always  possible that
      the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can
      be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different
      maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have
      dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such
      as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

      \ using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]).\
      \ Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit\
      \ representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org,\
      \ or other RDF vocabularies and \"knowledge graphs\". In that case the subproperty\
      \ of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.\u240A \
      \   \u240AThe [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification\
      \ is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented\
      \ towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader\
      \ applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement,\
      \ but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. \u240A\u240A\
      For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]]\
      \ could be: \"mass spectrometry\" or \"nmr spectroscopy\" or \"colorimetry\"\
      \ or \"immunofluorescence\". If the [[variableMeasured]] is \"depression rating\"\
      , the [[measurementTechnique]] could be \"Zung Scale\" or \"HAM-D\" or \"Beck\
      \ Depression Inventory\". \u240A\u240AIf there are several [[variableMeasured]]\
      \ properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for\
      \ each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]].\
      \ The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]]."
