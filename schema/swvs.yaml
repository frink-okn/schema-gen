- 'title: SemWeb Vocab Status ontology'
- 'description: This vocabulary was created in the FOAF project, based on experience
  with FOAF, Dublin Core and other early RDF vocabularies. Deployment experience shows
  that changing namespace URIs is expensive and unrewarding, so this vocabulary provides
  terms to support in-place evolution of structured data vocabularies. By indicating
  status at the level of terms rather than vocabularies, dictionary-style, fine grained
  improvements become easier. Different organizations and parties can agree or disagree
  on the status of a vocabulary term; however the status published alongside the term
  may deserve special attention. Future work could include patterns for citing announcements
  and decisions, or using SKOS to decentralise the extension of the basic status levels.'
