    description: The European Article Number (EAN) is a universal identifier for products,
      commonly printed in form of barcodes on them. The numbers represented by those
      codes can either be 8 or 13 digits long, with the 13-digit-version being most
      common. EANs form a superset of the North American Universal Product Code (UPC)
      as every UPC can be made an EAN by adding a leading zero to it. Additionally
      every EAN is also a Japanese Article Number (JAN). The identifiers were formerly
      assigned by EAN International which merged with Uniform Code Council (UCC, the
      guys behind the UPCs) and Electronic Commerce Council of Canada (ECCC) to become

      Like the ISRC (a code for identifying single recordings as found on releases)
      it was developed by the IFPI but it does not appear to be a standard of the

      The Label Code consists historically of 4 figures, presently being extended

      His Master's Voice). Note that the number of countries using the LC is limited,
      and that the code given on the item is not always accurate.
