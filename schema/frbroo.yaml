    - 'description: This class comprises the sums of concepts which appear in the
      course of the coherent evolution of an original idea into one or more expressions
      that are dominated by the original idea. The substance of Work is concepts.
      A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously or over time.
      A Work may have members that constitute components of the overall concept or
      that are alternatives to other members of the work. Members of a work may or
      may not represent the concept of the Work as a whole; for instance a translation
      reinterprets the whole, a volume of a trilogy represents a part of the concept.
      A Work can be either individual or complex. If it is individual its concept
      is completely realised in a single F22 Self-Contained Expression. If it is complex
      its concept is embedded in an F15 Complex Work. An F15 Complex Work consists
      of members that are either F15 Complex Works themselves or F14 Individual Works.
      The member relationship of Work is based on the members respecting the same
      concept, and should not be confused with the structural parts of an expression,
      that might be taken from other work(s). A Work is the product of an intellectual
      process of one or more persons, yet only indirect evidence about it is at our
      hands. This can be contextual information such as the existence of an order
      for a work, reflections of the creators themselves that are documented somewhere,
      and finally the expressions of the work created. As ideas normally take shape
      during discussion, elaboration and implementation, it is not reasonable to assume
      that a work starts with a complete concept. Moreover, it can be very difficult
      or impossible to define the whole of the concept of a work at some given time.
      The only objective evidence for such a notion can be based on a stage of expressions
      at a given time. In this sense, self-contained expressions serve as a kind of
      "snap-shots" of a work. A Work may aggregate expressions of other works into
      a new expression. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work
      in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that
      have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does
      not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only
      parts of the resulting expression.'

      are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular
      all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena.
      Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical

      of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor. There are
      two different conceptualisations of "artistic style", defined either by physical
      features or by historical context. For example, "Impressionism" can be viewed

      particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included

    - 'description: This property identifies an instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression
      that has been chosen as the most characteristic expression of the instance of
      F1 Work of which it is an expression. There is no other semantic implication
      to this notion of being characteristic than to be an adequate candidate to uniquely
      identify the Work realized by it. Prototypically, this is the instance of F22
      Self-Contained Expression that is deemed characteristic of an instance of F15
      Complex Work. Typically, any expression that is not regarded as "representative"
      for the work it expresses, would require a uniform title, with qualifiers specifying
      the differences between that expression and a representative expression, although
      this may not always be done in practice. The title of a Work may not be one
      taken from a representative expression. A given work can have more than one
      representative expression, provided the differences between these expressions
      are not deemed "substantial". If the anticipated needs of users are not considered
      to call for bibliographic distinctions between variant expressions of a work,
      then even expressions that differ significantly from each other can be regarded
      as equally representative for the work. (See FRBR: Final Report, p. 19-20).
      A given expression can be deemed representative for a work with regard to some
      of its aspects (e.g., the text contained in an edition the title proper of which
      reads "The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke", and the language
      of that text), and not representative for it with regard to some other aspects
      (e.g., the title proper "The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke"
      itself, which, being different from the title that is regarded as "representative"
      for Shakespeare''s work, will require the use of a uniform title). R40 has representative
      expression is a shortcut of the more developed path F1 Work R50B was assigned
      by F42 Representative Expression Assignment R51 assigned F2 Expression.'
