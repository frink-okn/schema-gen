    - 'description: This class comprises the sums of concepts which appear in the
      course of the coherent evolution of an original idea into one or more expressions
      that are dominated by the original idea. The substance of Work is concepts.
      A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously or over time.
      A Work may have members that constitute components of the overall concept or
      that are alternatives to other members of the work. Members of a work may or
      may not represent the concept of the Work as a whole; for instance a translation
      reinterprets the whole, a volume of a trilogy represents a part of the concept.
      A Work can be either individual or complex. If it is individual its concept
      is completely realised in a single F22 Self-Contained Expression. If it is complex
      its concept is embedded in an F15 Complex Work. An F15 Complex Work consists
      of members that are either F15 Complex Works themselves or F14 Individual Works.
      The member relationship of Work is based on the members respecting the same
      concept, and should not be confused with the structural parts of an expression,
      that might be taken from other work(s). A Work is the product of an intellectual
      process of one or more persons, yet only indirect evidence about it is at our
      hands. This can be contextual information such as the existence of an order
      for a work, reflections of the creators themselves that are documented somewhere,
      and finally the expressions of the work created. As ideas normally take shape
      during discussion, elaboration and implementation, it is not reasonable to assume
      that a work starts with a complete concept. Moreover, it can be very difficult
      or impossible to define the whole of the concept of a work at some given time.
      The only objective evidence for such a notion can be based on a stage of expressions
      at a given time. In this sense, self-contained expressions serve as a kind of
      "snap-shots" of a work. A Work may aggregate expressions of other works into
      a new expression. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work
      in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that
      have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does
      not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only
      parts of the resulting expression.'

      bounded in time and space. It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena
      that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These
      bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and
      retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and
      space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary
      culture. Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods
      such as the "Neolithic Period", the "Ming Dynasty" or the "McCarthy Era". There
      are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular
      all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena.
      Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical
      E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists
      of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor. There are
      two different conceptualisations of "artistic style", defined either by physical
      features or by historical context. For example, "Impressionism" can be viewed
      as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with
      particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included
      (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it
      can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics
      of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical
      context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological
      object types that fall under E55 Type. Another specific case of an E4 Period
      is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as
      the populated period of Nineveh. [This is the Scope note for E4 Period in CIDOC
      CRM version 5.0.1] [Note that in CIDOC CRM, E12 Production, E13 Attribute Assignment,
